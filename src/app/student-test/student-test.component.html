			An early detection of a cardiovascular disease could make the difference in terms of the success of a treatment, for that reason, it is important to test the reliability of the tools used to deliver the diagnoses, and measure the impact of external factors such as stress situations of alterations in the data collected, the students are an interesting case to show the effects of stress situations, as they can have a variable number of stress causing situations in their daily activity in shorts periods of time, this paper shows a case of study which measured the impact of stress situations in a self-diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases tool, using data from students while on vacations and on final exams, those 2 sets of data for each situation were compared as well as the results of the diagnosis, the analysis from the data showed that if well, some of the parameters can have a change and some tendencies can be found in the data, the addition of stress situations does not have a direct impact in the diagnosis.
